Codenames for UdonSharp

These are the files used to drive Codenames For Udon, a VRChat world. You need to use UdonSharp (https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp) to get this code into VRChat.

Don't expect any support for this. It's purely for reference. This code is current as of commit date, and the world this was built for is not anticipated to change.
